# project_01
[project deployment](https://Spell_Binder.surge.sh)

This project is styled as a Spell Library. Using the D&D API: https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ i will be able to generate a list of spells based off of the users class preference, and level.

this is the wire frame ![wireframe](/css/img/project01%20-%20Window.png)
this is the tentative color pallette ![Color Pallette](/css/img/pallette.png)

when the user first loads the page, all the potential spells are given in alphabetical order. in the nav bar user has four options. three of them are dropdowms, one for Spell Classes, Spell Schools Spell Levels.
there is a home button that will list out all of the spells again.

this p[roject will utilize Java Script, HTML, and CSS.]

 this is the final product![app Photo](/css/img/screenShot.png)

I ran into some trouble with getting the tables to generate, so I had the user input what exactly they want to generate. 
the header would stay on the page even though no table had been generated yet, so I decided to generate all spells when the page loaded.


in the future, I want to be able to get spells that have multiple variables applied to them. ie: all level 9 spells, for clerics, that are abjuration.

I want to add a search bar so that users can find the specific spell they want

I want to get some animations on the buttons and inputs.

I also want to make the borders of the table a little pretier, and add some fancy filagre to them.
